Make SbQuantiles and TreeNode templates. The number of bits in the
universe and SBQ_TEST should be template parameters.

Improve performance of SbQuantiles::rank and SbQuantiles::quantile.

Investigate if it is possible to merge Node::L and Node::w into a
union to save some space.

Use a custom allocator to measure memory usage.

Adapt space bound to sbq and add it to test_invariants.

Implement SbQuantiles::merge.
